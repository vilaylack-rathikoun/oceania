		<h1>WHY PROTECT OUR OCEANS?</h1>

Without healthy oceans, our generations will not survive.</h2>

		<h2>They allow us to breathe</h2>
		<p>Did you know that half of the oxygen we breathe comes from the oceans? Phytoplankton, a real “carbon pump”, absorbs around 30% of global CO2 emissions to transform it into oxygen. But pollution, the warming of the waters and the acidification of the oceans are gradually making this plankton disappear. </p>


		<h2>Over three billion people feed on the sea</h2>
		<p>Almost half of the world's population rely on fish as their main source of protein. Across the world, small fishing enterprises provide hundreds of millions of people with food and fixed income. The most vulnerable people depend on the oceans for their survival. </p>

		<h2>The oceans regulate the climate</h2>
		<p>The oceans have a formidable regulating effect on the temperatures of our planet. They absorb, store and transport heat from the sun in their movement, affecting the temperature and circulation of the atmosphere.</p>

		<h2 id="about-section">About us</h2>
		<p>Oceania is a project organized by a private organisation, which is based in Bali, Indonesia. Every year, we encourage the tourists and people from all around the world to take part in this project. Oceanina is dedicated to securing permanent, strong protection for the oceans’ most important places – for us and future generations.</p>

		<p>The ocean is the Earth’s biggest life support system, and healthy marine ecosystems are essential for human survival and well-being. As a leader in the global movement to protect vast ocean areas, Oceanina uses the latest science to identify important marine ecosystems, advocate for their protection, and measure progress toward effective, sustainable marine protection. Our priority is to help create an urgently-needed worldwide system of Blue Parks, or recognized highly protected areas, to ensure the future diversity and abundance of marine life.</p>

			<p>Hundreds of thousands of birds and marine mammals perish each year by ingesting this plastic waste which they confuse with their prey. Likewise, the fish that end up on our plates also ingest micro-debris.</p>
			<p>Each year, it is estimated that between 8 and 12 million tonnes of plastic end up in our oceans.  That's the equivalent of a garbage truck dumped every minute. This waste is visible in all the oceans of the world, at all depths, forming gigantic “plastic wastes".</p>
